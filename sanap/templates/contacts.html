<h2>Sending on the Self-assessment to your contacts and collecting their responses</h2>
<p>This platform is designed in such a way that country coordinators can easily
use it to gather responses from their contacts (e.g. researchers, EPAs, NGOs)
within their country.<br /><br />
Simply copy and send (e.g. via Email) the generated URL below to your contacts:
</p>

<p>
  <a href="{{ config.HOSTNAME }}{{ url }}">{{ config.HOSTNAME }}{{ url }}</a>
</p>
<p>
  Your contacts can only access and fill-in the survey using that URL.
  Their responses will be listed below, grouped by questions, so that you can more
  easily compile the final version of the Self-assessment
  and submit it to the European Environment Agency (EEA).
</p>
<h2>Responses received so far from your country contacts</h2>
